This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project consists in a client and an API. To make it easier to launch, I used the NPM Package "Concurrently", which will run both using one single script.

## How to make it work

To run the project, you will need NPM or Yarn installed. To clone the project, you can run:

### `git clone https://github.com/bconfortin/udacity-redux-readable-project.git`

To start the project, make sure you are inside the project's root folder and then simply run:

### `npm i --save`

### `npm start`

Alternatively, instead of `npm start`, you can run both scripts:

### `npm react-scripts start`

### `node api-server/server.js`

When finished, the browser should open. Just in case it doesn't, click here or copy and paste it in your favorite browser: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Other available Scripts

#### Note that these scripts were generated automatically and were not modified.

In the project's root directory, you can run:

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
